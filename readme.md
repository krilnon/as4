## About

AS4 is a programming language following the design guidance of the *ActionScript 4.0 Language Specification* from Adobe's Programming Language Research group.

### Name

Note that this language is simply called *AS4*, a name only coincidentally related the stillborn fourth version of the ActionScript programming language.

## Contributing

For now, send me a quick message before you start writing any significant new code.  Of course you can fork this on your own, but I won't accept wildly divergent pull requests here unless they're really neat.

This project is licensed under the MIT License.  See license.txt for the exact terms.  The only differences are that I sentence-cased some of the ridiculous uppercase text and used the Unicode copyright symbol instead of the silly alternatives like "(C)".
